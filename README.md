This repository is a complete project made by students at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki taking the *Spring 2021 Software Engineering Course (8th Semester)*. Objective of *assignment1* is to:
* set the Functional & Non-Functional requirements 
* develop the User Stories (behavior scenarios) in Gherkin language 
* interact with UI/UX Design and implement static modeling into UML class diagram notation

Objective of *assignment2* is to:
* adjust corresponding design patterns to project 
* struct a RESTful web-service using SwaggerHub
* build Node-RED flows 

## Users & external systems
###### Users
* Doctor [desktop user only]
* Registered Patient [mobile user only]
###### External systems
* Notification system
* Registered patients database 
* Unregistered patients database
* External APIs [Calendar, Print, Email, Text message]

## Functional & Non-Functional Requirements
User and System requirements of the application can be found in text format files. Refer to [FunctionalReq.txt](https://github.com/OxymoroVP/Proaid/blob/main/FunctionalReq.txt) / 
[NonFunctionalReq.txt](https://github.com/OxymoroVP/Proaid/blob/main/NonFunctionalReq.txt) <br/>
for an extended preview.

## User Stories 
User stories aim to facilitate sensemaking of the platform's functionality and they are implemented into 12 features, developed in <br/>*Gherkin language*.


## GUI & UML class diagram notation
###### UI/UX
Figma project link: http://tiny.cc/czbytz
###### UML - Static modeling
Structural (or Static) view emphasizes the static structure of the system using objects, attributes, operations and relationships. It includes class diagrams and composite structure diagrams and it is developed in StarUML environment. Refer to files classes.mdj / use_case.mdj for the *class and use case* diagram correspondingly.
